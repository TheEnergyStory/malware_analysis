# Project TajMahal IOCs and Registry Decrypter
Last year in April, Kaspersky released an article about a new complex malware framework dubbed TajMahal:
https://securelist.com/project-tajmahal/90240/

Later the same year, one of the stated samples from Kaspersky report was uploaded to Virustotal:
https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/0b74fc2594b25987841a7897aff323f4165519e6c26d679256cb0d282a6f0147/

The sample is a `.NET assembly` with obfuscated strings but self explaining code after decompilation ([dnSpy](https://github.com/0xd4d/dnSpy) or [ILSpy](https://github.com/icsharpcode/ILSpy)). As the names of the namespace and classes imply, the sample's main purpose is to manage the Windows service persistency.

This repository contains the `decompiled code with decoded strings` (I left the deobfuscation method in the code), `extracted IOCs` and a `registry config data decryper`.

### Decompiled and Deobfuscated code
After decompilation and string decoding we have a perfect readable C# code. See: 

### IOCs
| Type | Details |
| ------ | ------ |
| Scheduled task with name | MaintenancePolicy |
| Registry values | Key: HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\AdaptiveDisplayBrightness |
| | Value: seg0 (unknown content) |
| | Value: seg4 (contains encrypted service config data) |

### Code oddities
The code contains two errors in the `Tools` class, not sure if they are caused by the decompilation engine or are actual coding errors.

1 ) While the Enum reg key is created for the Windows service (`text2`), it uses the before created registry path of the service itself to set the values (`text`)
```
text2 = @"SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\";
text2 += this.regdata.srvName;
text2 += @"\Enum";
using (RegistryKey registryKey3 = Registry.LocalMachine.CreateSubKey(text))
{
	registryKey3.SetValue("0", @"Root\LEGACY_SRVC\0000", RegistryValueKind.String);
	registryKey3.SetValue("Count", 1, RegistryValueKind.DWord);
	registryKey3.SetValue("NextInstance", 1, RegistryValueKind.DWord);
	registryKey3.Close();
}
```
2 ) There is a method named `DeleteTask` which uses `Security` as a file name to delete a scheduled task. Maybe there is a custom executable named `Security.exe` in the same directory with such functionality, but it's more likely that the author wanted to use `schtasks.exe` according to the used arguments.
```
public int DeleteTask()
{
	this.RunProgram("Security", @"/Delete /TN \Microsoft\Windows\Maintenance\MaintenancePolicy /F", true);
	return 0;
}

public int RunProgram(string exe, string cmd, bool waitfor)
{
	Process process = new Process();
	process.StartInfo.FileName = exe;
```

### Registry config data decrypter 
The sample tries to get RC4 encrypted data from a registry key (see IOCs) and use that data for the service set up. I have coded a config data decryptor for those who are infected. See: 

Config data description:

| Data | Explanation |
| ------ | ------ |
| DisplayName | Persistence service display name value under "SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\<Name>" |
| Description | Persistence service description value under "SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\<Name>" |
| Name | Persistence service name key under "SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\" |
| entryPoint | Name in "ServiceMain" under "SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\<Name>\Parameters" which describes the service DLL's entry point (export function name) |
| srvPath | Unknown, likely service DLL path |
| markerPath | Unkown, likely infection validation file |
| task_name | Unkown, likely scheduled task name |
| ttl | Date of self destruction |
